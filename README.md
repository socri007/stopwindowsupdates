Are You Suffering From Automatic Windows Updates That Consume Internet And Bother You?
Stop Windows Updates Program is an easy-to-use tool that allows you to control stopping Windows operating system updates. It is a program that checks the status type of the Windows Automatic Updates service to see if it is running (Running), stopped (Stopped), or pending (Start Pending - Stop Pending), and checks the startup type to see if it is automatic (Automatic), manual (Manual), or disabled (Disabled) to organize them according to the user's desire by choosing what suits them in the program interface. The program allows you to stop automatic updates for the Windows operating system in the services app from running to stopped when the user wants to stop the updates service while browsing the internet or for any other reason, and restart it when they want. It can also disable the startup type to disabled from the settings screen and not from the program interface, and it cannot disable it unless after reading the warnings, risks, and tips mentioned and taking full responsibility for this procedure. Knowing that it is not possible to disable the startup type to disabled permanently in modern versions of Windows, as Windows automatically restarts the startup type to manual after a period of time.

# Why Do You Need This Program?
üéØ Saving Internet Package Consumption
Automatic updates consume a large amount of data in the background without the user's knowledge, which affects limited internet packages.

‚öôÔ∏è Control Over Updates
Many users do not need all automatic updates and want to update the system manually only when needed, to maintain system stability and save resources.

üí° Ease of Use
The need for a simple and easy program with a clear user interface, allowing control over Windows updates without the need for complex steps. As a user: I believe that I do not need all these updates because I perform a comprehensive update for everything I need from drivers and the like when installing the Windows system and installing the antivirus, I only update Windows Defender from time to time and this suits me very well and I do not need more. There are similar programs, but I did not find an easy and simple program that does what I want, so I made a copy with a very simple interface that fulfills the requirement, but a friend suggested that I pay a little attention to the program's appearance and development. This program has effectively met these needs for me and provided me with a comfortable and easy user experience to control Windows updates manually.
